# Compass

Compass is a proof-of-concept Python script designed for Windows that can accurately determine the direction a player in Fortnite is facing by analyzing the player icon on an in-game map. The ultimate goal is to adapt this script to use the in-game mini-map and repurpose it for positioning and navigation, aiming to enhance accessibility for visually impaired players. Even though it's not finished, I am putting Compass up here to allow anyone to use it freely for their own projects, or even to help make games more accessible.

## Keybinds

* Just one for now! use "ALT + H" to activate it, and make sure your map is opened by pressing "M". It provides spoken feedback to screenreaders using 'accessible_output2' and saves an image upon pressing ALT + H. You can remove the saving of the screenshot near the bottom of the code.
